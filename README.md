# Features 
- it contains a card visual
- Three clustered column charts

# ANALYSIS
Every other information about the restaurant was displayed.
# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
From the highest rated restaurant, the following can be seen;
- They have high food and service rating
- Most of them do not serve the most  preferred customer cuisine
- Their prices are low and medium aside 'Restaurant las Manantias'
- Smoking is not allowed in the top three high rated restaurant
- Their customers are both social, causal drinker and abstemious 
   Also, customers preferences do not have an effect on the ratings of the restaurants.
        
2.**From the customers demographics**, it can be seen that the data set has more of single people represented than married people.Most of them  are not smokers,they use a public means of transportation, they stay in *san luis potosi* which is also where most restaurants are situated.  From the marital status, city and occupation we can say that there might be cases of bias as one group is mostly represented in the data set than another

3. **From the third dashboard**, there is a demand and supply gap as what the customers prefer the most ( mexican food) is not totally served by the highest rated restaurants. 
If the highest rated restaurants, takes charge of the preferences of their customers with their already high food and service rating would make more sales and customers satisfied.

 4.  **Some characteristics** that i would be looking out for if i were to invest in a restaurant would include  restaurants that;
- Have quality service and food rating
- Serve most of the customers preferences 
- Have a medium or low price
- Is loacted where most costumes reside
  
# RECOMMENDATIONS
 - Most of the restaurants should serve at a reduced price or have a more affordable pricing.
 - Restaurants should conduct follow-up surveys to understand trends over time.
 - Align your menu and services with the preferences identified in the customer survey
- Identify aspects of the restaurant experience (e.g., service, ambiance) that are receiving low ratings and implement improvements.
- Target Marketing: Use customer segmentation data to tailor marketing campaigns to different customer groups
